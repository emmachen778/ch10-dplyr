# Exercise 1: Data Frame Practice

# Install devtools package: allows installations from GitHub
install.packages('devtools')

# Install "fueleconomy" package from GitHub
devtools::install_github("hadley/fueleconomy")

# Require/library the fueleconomy package
library(fueleconomy)

# You should have have access to the `vehicles` data.frame


# Create a data.frame of vehicles from 1997
cars.from.97 <- vehicles[vehicles$year == 1997,]

# Use the `unique` function to verify that there is only 1 value in the `year` column of your new data.frame
unique(cars.from.97$year)

# Create a data.frame of 2-Wheel Drive vehicles that get more than 20 miles/gallon in the city
two.wheel.over.20 <- vehicles[vehicles$drive == '2-Wheel Drive' & vehicles$ct > 20,]

# Of those vehicles, what is the vehicle ID of the vehicle with the worst hwy mpg?
worst.hwy <- two.wheel.over.20$id[two.wheel.over.20$hwy == min(two.wheel.over.20$hwy)]

# Write a function that takes a `year` and a `make` as parameters, and returns 
# The vehicle that gets the most hwy miles/gallon of vehicles of that make in that year

of.yr.make <- vehicles[vehicles$year == 1995 & vehicles$make == 'Honda',]
most.hwy <- of.yr.make[of.yr.make$hwy == max(of.yr.make$hwy),]

MostHwy <- function(year, make) {
  of.yr.make <- vehicles[vehicles$year == year & vehicles$make == make,]
  most.hwy <- of.yr.make[of.yr.make$hwy == max(of.yr.make$hwy),]
  return (most.hwy)
}

# What was the most efficient honda model of 1995?
most.efficient <- MostHwy(1995,'Honda')
